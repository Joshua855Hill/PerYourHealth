## Description


PerYourHealth is a modern, user-friendly web application focused on helping individuals manage their personal health finances and track medical expenses with clarity and confidence. It combines a clean, accessible interface with practical tools for logging receipts, categorizing medical costs, and generating simple receipts or summaries suitable for insurance claims or tax records. Designed for everyday users as well as caregivers and small-practice administrators, PerYourHealth streamlines the process of recording payments, attaching notes, and viewing organized expense histories across multiple visits and providers. The project emphasizes data portability and ease-of-use: users can quickly add expense items, review transactions, filter by category or date range, and export records for local backup or sharing with professionals. Built with maintainability and extensibility in mind, the codebase demonstrates modular React components so developers can easily extend features, integrate third-party services, or adapt the interface for varied accessibility requirements. Although this sample app stores data locally for demonstration, the design recommends security-minded practices, including careful local storage handling, privacy notices, and optional backend integration for encrypted persistence. PerYourHealth is a practical starter template and a helpful personal tool for those seeking an organized way to monitor and report their healthcare spending, while remaining lightweight and approachable.
